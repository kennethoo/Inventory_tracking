This application is an inventory tracking web application that has a basic front end in React and a backend in Node.js.
You can add an inventory and select a warehouse where the inventory is located. You can create, update, and delete an inventory.
The inventory can be any product; shoes, headphones, laptops, phones, etc. 
To run the application, you can just clone the project and run npm start on the front end folder, and npm start on the backend folder
and play with the application. I will post a link to the working project.
There are so many possibilities for this application, but I wanted to focus on  the requirements of the project.
